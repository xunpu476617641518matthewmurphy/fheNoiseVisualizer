# FHE Noise Visualizer: A Real-Time Monitoring Tool for FHE Computations

The FHE Noise Visualizer is a powerful developer tool designed to provide real-time monitoring of noise levels in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) computations, leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This tool plays a crucial role in optimizing circuit designs and ensuring the accuracy of computation results by visualizing the growth of noise during the encryption process.

## Identifying the Problem

Developers working with FHE face significant challenges in managing the "noise" that accumulates during computations. High noise levels can compromise the reliability of encrypted calculations, leading to incorrect outputs. As FHE becomes more widely adopted for secure data processing, there is a pressing need for tools that can help developers monitor and analyze these noise levels effectively. Without an intuitive way to visualize and understand noise growth, debugging and optimizing FHE applications can be cumbersome and error-prone.

## How FHE Addresses the Issue

The FHE Noise Visualizer employs **Zama's open-source libraries**, including **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**, to provide a seamless experience for developers. By visualizing noise levels in real time, this tool empowers developers to make data-driven decisions in their FHE circuit designs. The ability to monitor noise growth allows for timely interventions to maintain the integrity of computations, directly enhancing the reliability of FHE applications.

## Core Functionalities

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously track the noise level in FHE ciphertext, providing instantaneous feedback to developers.
- **Noise Growth Visualization:** Interactive charts that display noise growth curves, allowing developers to identify trends and potential issues quickly.
- **Enhanced Debugging Support:** Key insights into FHE computations help streamline the debugging process, ensuring correctness in encryption.
- **User-friendly Interface:** A straightforward and intuitive interface designed to cater to the needs of developers working in cryptography and data visualization.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK:** Core library for implementing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
- **Concrete:** An efficient FHE library for performance optimization.
- **TFHE-rs:** A Rust implementation of FHE, enabling secure and fast computations.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime used for building the application.
- **Hardhat or Foundry:** Development environments for compiling and running the project.

## Installation Guide

To get started with the FHE Noise Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and Hardhat/Foundry installed on your machine. If not, install them before proceeding.
2. **Download the project:** Download the project files to your local machine using your preferred method (do not use `git clone`).
3. **Navigate to the directory:** Open your terminal and change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/fheNoiseVisualizer
   ```
4. **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install all necessary packages, including the Zama FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Build & Run Guide

Once the installation is complete, you can build and run the FHE Noise Visualizer using the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contract:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. **Run Tests:** Ensure everything is functioning correctly by running the test suite:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
3. **Start the Application:** Finally, launch the application:
   ```bash
   node src/main.js
   ```

### Example Usage

Here's a sample snippet demonstrating how to utilize the main function of the FHE Noise Visualizer:

```javascript
import { initializeNoiseMonitor } from './noiseVisualizer';

async function main() {
    const monitor = await initializeNoiseMonitor();
    
    // Start monitoring noise levels
    monitor.startMonitoring();
    
    // Log noise levels in real-time
    monitor.on('noiseLevelUpdate', (level) => {
        console.log(`Current noise level: ${level}`);
    });
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

This example initializes the noise monitoring tool and logs the current noise level as it updates, providing insight into the FHE computation process.
